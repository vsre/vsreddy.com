          'Speech by Sri Jagannadha Rao : With a single computer in August 1998, the OSS DTP Institute was founded in a  rental shop.   It took 8 months until March 1999 to set up a second computer. OSS is indebted to Mr. Jagannadharao for donating a computer and helping the development of OSS DTP Institute in such a financial situation. Due to the untiring efforts of the staff and the Brain Bench International Certificates crowed by the Teachers of the institute, OSS now stands proudly in the competitive arena National of Computer Educational Institutions offering different courses right from Computer basics to the present day competitive needs of computer education and training.  All our past students who are now holding different important posts in various offices/organizations can be put to the strict proof of achievements and standards.  We would like to prove the essence of our logo "Learning is Infinite" and perpetuate OSS further through many other services.',
